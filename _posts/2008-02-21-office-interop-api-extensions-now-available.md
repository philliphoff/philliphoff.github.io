<P>As announced in Andrew Whitechapel's <A class="" title="VSTO/VSTA Power Tools v1.0" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andreww/archive/2008/02/21/vsto-vsta-power-tools-v1-0.aspx">post</A>, version 1.0 of the VSTO Power Tools have been released!&nbsp; One of those tools is the Office Interop API Extensions, a set of libraries which extend the Office object model to simplify development on the Office platform.&nbsp; This past week I've blogged about the capabilities of these extensions and now you have the&nbsp;chance to try them out yourselves!&nbsp; Please let us know what works, what doesn't, what could be improved, and what you would like to see in the future.</P>
<P>The VSTO Power Tools v1.0.0.0 is a collection of three packages&nbsp;found <A class="" title="VSTO Power Tools v1.0.0.0" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=46B6BF86-E35D-4870-B214-4D7B72B02BF9&amp;displaylang=en">here</A>.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Office Interop API Extensions is packaged as&nbsp;VSTO_PTExtLibs.exe.&nbsp; Please note that, despite the prerequisites listed on the MSDN download page, the Office Interop API Extensions can be used with both Office 2007 <STRONG>and</STRONG> Office 2003, though .NET 3.5 is&nbsp;required in both cases.&nbsp; Also, these extensions do <STRONG>not</STRONG> have a dependency on VSTO; they can be used within any application which automates Office.</P>
