title: "VSTO at Portland Code Camp v3.0"
date: 2007-05-22

Yesterday I gave a presentation on VSTO at the third annual [Portland Code Camp](http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/3/default.aspx). I demonstrated an Outlook 2007 add-in that used Outlook Form Regions, WCF, and WPF to integrate [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) Wish Lists with contact items. As my first public speaking event since joining Microsoft last November, I thought it went pretty well.

I've attached the add-in that I created during the presentation. You will need to sign up with Amazon and receive an access key before it can be run. The add-in was developed with [Visual Studio "Orcas" Beta1](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx).
