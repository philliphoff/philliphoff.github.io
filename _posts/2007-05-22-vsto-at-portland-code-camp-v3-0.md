<p>Yesterday I gave a presentation on VSTO at the third annual <a href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/3/default.aspx">Portland Code Camp</a>.&nbsp; I demonstrated an Outlook 2007 add-in that used Outlook Form Regions, WCF, and WPF to integrate <a href="https://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> Wish Lists with contact items.&nbsp; As my first public speaking event since joining Microsoft last November, I thought it went pretty well.</p>
<P>I've attached the add-in that&nbsp;I created&nbsp;during the presentation.&nbsp; You will need to sign up with Amazon and receive an access key before it can be run.&nbsp; The add-in was developed with <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx">Visual Studio "Orcas" Beta1</a>.</p>
